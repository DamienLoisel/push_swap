# push_swap

## Description

The **push_swap** project at 42 involves creating a program that sorts a list of integers using the minimum number of operations. The sorting is done using two stacks and a series of operations to manipulate the data between them. The goal is to implement an efficient sorting algorithm and to find the optimal sequence of operations.

## Features

- **Two Stack Sorting**: Implement a sorting algorithm using two stacks (Stack A and Stack B).
- **Operations**: Support for various operations including push, swap, and rotate operations to manipulate the stacks.
- **Optimal Sorting**: Calculate and apply the minimum number of operations required to sort the list.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors such as invalid input and duplicate values.
